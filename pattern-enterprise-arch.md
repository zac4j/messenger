Patterns

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice -- Christopher Alexander

Another way of looking at it is that a pattern is a chunk of advice and the art of creating patterns is to divide up many pieces pf advice into relatively independent chunks so that you can refer to them and discuss them more or less separetely.
