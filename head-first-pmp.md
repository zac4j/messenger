## Head first PMP
Passing the PMP exam is your ticket to putting that wisdom into practice.

#### Three core characteristics of a successful PM
+ Knowledge:means knowing all of the tools and technique in the PMBOK Guide and how and when to use them.
+ Performance:You and your team will have to work hard to deliver a successful project, too.
+ Personal skills: Your job as a PM is to make personal connections with your team and help keep everybody on the right track.

#### Understand company's big picture:Portfolio, Program and Project
+ A **protfolio** is a group of projects or programs that are linked together by a business goal.
+ A **program** is a collection of projects that should be managed together in order to achieve a specific goal or benefit to the company.
+ A **project** gathers a team together to do work that's **temporary**, creates a **unique result**, and is **progressively elaborated**.
+ A **project charter** is a document that describes a project's **requirements** and **high-level schedule**, assigns a project manager, and authorizes the project.
+ An **operation**(or **process**) is work that's done in a way that's **repeatable** and **ongoing**, but its not a project.

#### A day in the life of a PM
You can categorize everything a pm does everyday into three categorizes.
+ Gather product requirements:
	figuring out what you're going to build.
+ Manage stakeholder expectations:
	the one who pay for it,the one who will use the product when you're done, the one who might be impacted by the project.
+ Deal with project constraints:
	A project constraint is any limitation that's placed on your project before you start doing the work.*(there’s a good chance that a competitor will beat you to it if you don’t plan it well?)*

#### How PM run great projects
One goal of the PMBOK Guide is to give you a repeatable way to run your projects. It does so by breaking the work down into **47 processes** that describe different, specific kinds of work that project managers do.
There are two diff ways to think about them:
+ Each process falls into one of the **5 process groups**, which tell you the sequence that the processes are performed on a project.
+ Each process also falls into one of **10 knowledge ares**. The PMBOK Guide is a tool for origanizing knowledge about project management.

#### PMOs help you do a good job
**Project management offices(PMOs)** will give you the **templates** and the **guidance** you need to make sure your project takes the right approach and make sense to everyone you work with. There are three different kinds of PMOs that you might run into your career.
+ Supportive:
	They'll lay out the standards for how you should communicate your project's scope, resources, schedule, and status as your project progresses from its initial stages through to delivery and closing.
+ Controlling:
	They’ll tell you what templates you should fill out and prescribe a framework for doing project management in your company.
+ Directive:
	They'll provide pms to project teams, the pm usually reports to the PMO directly. That reporting structure makes sure that the project managers follow the frameworks and templates prescribed by the PMO, cause their job performance depends on it.

#### Interpersonal skills
+ Leadership
	A good leader gets the team to **see the end goal** and focus on getting there.
+ Team building and trust building
	Everything you do to help team members feel like they can **rely on another** is part of team building. Trust building is all about **sharing information with all of your stakeholders** so that they know they can trust one another
+ Motivation:
	Understanding what motivates your team members and helping them to achieve their **personal goals** will help your project.
	- someone are motivated by the kind of work they do.
	- some are looking for experience that will help their resumes.
	- some are hoping for a promotion or a pay raise.
+ Influencing:
	When you influence people, you focus on the **shared benefit** of the work with them and share power toward a common goal.
+ Coaching:
	PM is always looking for ways to help the team **get better at what they do**.
+ Conflict management:
	PM works to find positive solutions when conflicts pop up.
+ Political and cultural awareness
	It's important to make sure that everybody on the team **feels included**. You need to be aware of the topics that might alienate people or make them feel uncomfortable, so that you can maintain an **open and inclusive** environment on your team.

How are team building and coaching different?
Team building usually means going out, having lunch, doing group exercises, and in general socializing as a team so that the group gets more familiar with one another and can have a better internal set of relationships. Coaching is about identifying your team members' talent and helping them develop them.

#### The process framework
+ Once you know all the processes in your project fit together, it's easy to remember everything you need to know for the PMP exam.
+ The **process groups** and **knowledge areas** is the key to all of this happening smoothly.
